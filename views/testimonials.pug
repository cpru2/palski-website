  h3 Our name
  p
    | The name, Palski & Associates, was inspired by a small group of extraordinary satellite
    | systems engineers. The team had just successfully demonstrated the capabilities of an
    | experimental satellite system and was celebrating over dinner. Mike, who led the effort,
    | was giving out plaques recognizing each team member for their dedication and
    | growth over the 3-year project.
  p
    | To an outsider, it would have seemed like these engineers were lifelong friends. The long hours
    | working together on such a high-stakes mission had bonded them in a way passing time simply cannot. And even though they
    | were all technically working for one of the largest aerospace companies in the U.S., Lockheed Martin, they often
    | felt like a separate unit, distanced from the corporate drudgery and bureaucratic processes, via their common goal.
    | They often joked about how effective they could be if they started their own company, led under Mike, who
    | the younger engineers looked to for mentorship, and the older ones respected as a highly skilled colleague.
  p
    | After Mike finished handing out awards, the team surprised him with their own gift,
    | a polo shirt with an embroidered logo that read "Palski & Associates." Mike had an affinity for polos, so the gift
    | was a somewhat precipitous inside joke, planting the seed for an engineering firm seven years later, after Mike
    | met his life partner, Kathryn, a chemical engineer who had similar experiences leading teams to
    | extraordinary results at Dupont and Koch Industries.
  p
    | The two moved to El Segundo, California, to work together at an aerospace firm called The S.I. Almost immediately,
    | Kathryn, who was a newcomer to the aerospace industry, began noticing inefficiencies and silos that skyrocketed costs
    | of the projects they worked on. She shared these thoughts with Mike, who still fondly remembered the agile team of Lockheed engineers who
    | had gifted him the polo.
  p
    | Two years past, and both were still unhappy with the culture brought to light by Kathryn. They longed to create a
    | culture inspired by their higher-order values of integrity, nimbleness, and discipline, ideals shared by their S.I.
    | coworkers, but ultimately quashed through too many people, dinosaur processes, and misaligned incentives. They also felt a duty
    | to mentor young engineers into this philosophy, growing and developing them into the engineering leaders of the future.
